RETRIEVAL SKIPPING TEST
==================================================
Testing if Tier 1 model correctly identifies when retrieval is needed


=== Simple arithmetic (should skip) ===
Query: "What is 2+2?"
✅ Response in 14886ms
   Tools: retrieval_aggregator → socratic_tool
   Retrieval: ❌ USED (slow)

=== Complex concept (needs retrieval) ===
Query: "What is photosynthesis?"
✅ Response in 6722ms
   Tools: retrieval_aggregator → socratic_tool
   Retrieval: ❌ USED (slow)

=== Meta conversation (should skip) ===
Query: "Thanks"
✅ Response in 10997ms
   Tools: socratic_tool
   Retrieval: ✅ SKIPPED (fast)

=== Complex request (needs retrieval) ===
Query: "Explain quantum mechanics"
✅ Response in 9652ms
   Tools: retrieval_aggregator → socratic_tool
   Retrieval: ❌ USED (slow)

=== Yes/No question (should skip) ===
Query: "Is 5 greater than 3?"
✅ Response in 5883ms
   Tools: retrieval_aggregator → socratic_tool
   Retrieval: ❌ USED (slow)

=== Calculation (should skip) ===

==================================================
SUMMARY
==================================================

Should skip retrieval: 1/4 correct
Needs retrieval: 2/2 correct

Average time WITH retrieval: 9191ms
Average time WITHOUT retrieval: 10997ms
Speed improvement: -20%
