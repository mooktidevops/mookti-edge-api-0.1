### 2.2 Sampling Logic

#### **Full Analysis (100% reviewed, ~15% of total)**
- Sessions under 2000 tokens (most conversations)
- High frustration detected (≥6/10)
- Multiple tool switches
- Abandoned sessions (<6 messages)
- Explicit feedback provided
- First 100 sessions per day (baseline quality)

#### **Standard Analysis (50% sampled, ~30% of total)**
- Medium-length sessions (6-20 messages)
- Some confusion or struggle detected
- Single tool switch
- Moderate token count (2000-5000)

#### **Light Sampling (10% sampled, ~15% of total)**
- Long successful sessions
- No frustration indicators
- Consistent tool use
- High token count (>5000)

#### **Skip Review (~40% of total)**
- Meta-conversations ("thanks", "hello")
- Very short exchanges (<3 messages)
- Duplicate/cached responses

## 3. Review Pipeline Architecture

### 3.1 Processing Flow

```python
# Pseudo-code for review pipeline
async def process_conversation_batch():
    sessions = await get_completed_sessions(last_6_hours)
    
    for session in sessions:
        # Step 1: Quick classification
        priority = classify_session_priority(session)
        
        # Step 2: Sampling decision
        should_review = determine_sampling(priority, session)
        
        if not should_review:
            continue
            
        # Step 3: Select review depth
        review_tier = select_review_tier(priority, token_count)
        
        # Step 4: Execute review
        review = await analyze_conversation(session, review_tier)
        
        # Step 5: Store insights
        await store_review_results(review)
        
        # Step 6: Flag if needed
        if review.needs_human_review:
            await flag_for_human_review(review)
```

### 3.2 Review Models & Costs

| Tier | Model | Cost/1M tokens | Use Case | Coverage |
|------|-------|----------------|----------|----------|
| Classification | Gemini 2.5 Flash | $0.30 | Initial triage | 100% |
| Light | Gemini 2.5 Flash | $0.30 | Quick quality check | 15% |
| Standard | Gemini 2.5 Flash | $0.30 | Detailed analysis | 30% |
| Full | O4-Mini | $2.40 | Deep pedagogical review | 15% |
| Critical | Human Review | ~$50/hour | Flagged issues | <1% |

### 3.3 Cost Projections

Assuming 10,000 sessions/day at launch:
- Average session: 3000 tokens
- Classification: 10,000 × 500 tokens × $0.30/1M = **$1.50/day**
- Full reviews: 1,500 × 3000 tokens × $2.40/1M = **$10.80/day**
- Standard reviews: 3,000 × 3000 tokens × $0.30/1M = **$2.70/day**
- Light reviews: 1,500 × 1000 tokens × $0.30/1M = **$0.45/day**
- **Total: ~$15.45/day** for comprehensive quality monitoring

At $25,200/month session costs, review costs = **$463/month (1.8%)**

## Conclusion

This hybrid review pipeline provides comprehensive quality monitoring while maintaining cost efficiency. By combining intelligent sampling, tiered analysis depth, and automated pattern detection, we can ensure Ellen maintains high pedagogical standards as we scale from thousands to millions of interactions.

The key innovation is the dynamic sampling strategy that guarantees we catch critical issues (100% review of high-priority sessions) while efficiently sampling routine interactions. This approach gives us confidence in quality while keeping costs under 2% of operational expenses.
