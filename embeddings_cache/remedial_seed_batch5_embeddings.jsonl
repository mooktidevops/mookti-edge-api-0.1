A **sample** is a subset. The **sampling distribution** of a statistic (like the mean) is the distribution of that statistic over many repeated samples. Means vary less than raw data; their spread is the **standard error**, which shrinks with larger n (∝ 1/√n)."},"embedding":[0.034579743,0.035140794,-0.023519209,0.021982741,0.023812603,0.003402631,-0.008840817,0.012952387,0.020187089,-0.019812049,-0.012368523,0.030441603,0.014620181,-0.057441968,0.00377344,0.02405224,-0.035815429,-0.029965257,0.048403002,-0.038083013,0.031394362,0.03505104,-0.002454353,0.030955227,0.018187912,-0.036996815,-0.035124395,-0.056183346,-0.052328385,0.001962433,-0.051064949,0.057424925,-0.011332364,0.010648044,0.027997177,-0.042672824,0.020334043,-0.019450301,0.060921852,0.015514342,0.00244306,-0.031975597,-0.003988011,0.024772599,0.022304146,-0.053236168,-0.024388889,0.001349386,-0.051499017,-0.006186085,-0.004509646,-0.050518245,-0.003734114,-0.096425511,-0.009976733,-0.013710148,0.004840389,-0.033753242,-0.03668822,-0.048266452,-0.059727442,-0.005235942,-0.030017328,-0.00906245,-0.020565761,0.017996844,0.003680988,0.014375062,0.007666234,0.029427715,-0.063612029,0.026383718,0.026657486,-0.027122807,-0.04270624,0.029154314,0.023103431,0.011758207,0.022098094,0.029941207,0.021328468,0.030585933,-0.022948191,0.00057437,-0.038736735,-0.066299036,-0.012746053,0.03255257,0.004987924,0.024089132,0.011186186,-0.030790344,0.000407038,0.05418418,0.01652668,0.035441004,-0.059596721,0.003835919,-0.026498234,-0.026783029,-0.040963225,-0.012084261,-0.015792023,0.000037411,0.009097529,-0.001067856,-0.048646141,0.003140722,-0.022396358,0.005681539,-0.005477579,-0.013004356,-0.022147307,0.030427648,-0.009236945,0.028820483,0.007856752,-0.020676373,0.044659395,0.010593243,-0.01190956,-0.034772106,0.018696938,0.020770505,-0.040882006,0.017365726,0.078371264,0.035341915,-0.022084095,0.040978245,-0.088735737,0.050889432,0.0947069,0.034646101,-0.019430313,-0.01142291,-0.007000244,-0.022323217,-0.027645424,0.033541635,0.004709326,0.046861865,0.028444823,-0.006002146,0.049813654,0.038090382,-0.015856752,0.022137713,0.01991109,0.005733879,-0.002457984,0.033293385,-0.017619304,-0.056363497,-0.014840381,-0.026311528,0.028263317,0.002245196,0.018922154,0.006774572,-0.019966688,-0.001470871,0.061247155,0.020432891,0.039514698,-0.0238165,0.011570416,0.004775153,0.054526426,0.024816997,-0.025341349,0.011944961,-0.008484599,-0.021212937,-0.016094193,0.005419198,0.017310025,0.008706248,0.007835105,-0.022193713,0.029970406,0.024804238,-0.042732809,0.025554152,-0.009454455,-0.041961953,0.005527791,-0.028710514,-0.017806193,-0.001598402,0.024068465,0.016327526,0.007652084,0.008639955,0.017057877,0.016231826,0.045921665,-0.018309839,-0.015616406,0.031022204,0.002845334,0.005974879,-0.001299891,-0.000727961,0.065686978,-0.062296387,0.010754596,-0.059397902,-0.044349916,-0.007068078,-0.005073973,0.007882179,-0.029499205,0.03302706,0.011857014,0.014210162,-0.043954886,-0.021494834,0.031515822,0.029915636,-0.044031307,-0.006416238,-0.018295765,-0.035162531,0.029981216,0.044782504,0.046713021,-0.005091146,0.009551672,0.000021137,0.016458679,0.011473878,-0.017043736,-0.032776676,0.004228824,-0.010617779,0.049684729,-0.031923495,0.028622301,0.030329138,-0.039531786,0.029032754,0.040494058,-0.072243758,0.013647933,-0.047683105,0.034304239,0.01128755,-0.076579429,0.003310136,0.004517775,0.044156365,-0.008387191,-0.005954908,-0.030547358,0.004450324,-0.022472728,0.000898983,-0.042297687,0.01888261,-0.068122573,-0.012826347,0.000818506,0.021759178,0.044402815,0.000083683,-0.003544845,-0.005802783,-0.007820899,0.016966699,-0.013927266,-0.02596817,-0.000848255,-0.025293676,0.088837646,-0.009035333,-0.010543631,-0.008255112,0.029217035,-0.029763348,0.029550409,0.03845885,-0.004580704,0.011711068,-0.010563645,0.044149503,-0.017184101,0.042999994,0.054370001,0.035944916,0.003710695,-0.030068174,0.010127957,0.048189133,-0.014253468,0.018009786,0.011043339,-0.042376623,0.010126875,0.03636333,0.008351929,-0.001044761,-0.003710845,-0.000072869,-0.05993573,0.005790295,0.042682517,-0.006889577,0.077698864,-0.006462735,-0.014819427,0.004039317,-0.063507006,-0.022245606,-0.029379677,-0.002453595,-0.022690279,0.001850767,0.012314672,-0.015253498,0.011388198,0.010812553,0.028885311,0.030964257,-0.004295776,0.025451081,0.030900626,0.074922539,0.040694334,-0.007427753,0.003070714,0.002217529,0.017651202,0.007732502,-0.038913045,0.056273565,0.011218833,-0.037420377,-0.005432573,-0.00016625,-0.022567388,-0.001914112,-0.067931421,-0.019433312,0.046342496,-0.036253899,-0.029709645,0.048963964,0.007456186,0.025532657,0.084827133,-0.079242565,-0.038864978,0.004195936,0.015741106,0.022425972,0.004568195,0.085961483,-0.043510847,-0.001615571,-0.022930052,0.01317312,-0.011077484,0.011741834,-0.016317824,-0.01949927,-0.000005813,-0.01283196,-0.01203654,0.020181859,0.006415209,-0.013828475,0.000086448,-0.00511075,-0.03316766,-0.032283526,-0.023084475,0.041509796,0.000753446,0.014906541,0.002550095,-0.001596204,-0.05981392,-0.042010128,-0.000175677,-0.012193678,0.008856591,-0.027727908,-0.018996874,-0.050018162,-0.012097003,-0.002683036,0.006498713,0.000182007,-0.012275645,0.016899263,0.05303197,0.00123244,0.003733157,0.023070784,0.021463087,-0.0582722
