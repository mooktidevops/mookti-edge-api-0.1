Integrating factor.\nStep: Multiply ODE: e^{2x}y' + 2e^{2x}y = 6 e^{0} = 6. - Why: LHS becomes derivative of μy.\nStep: Recognize (e^{2x}y)' = 6. - Why: Product rule reversal.\nStep: Integrate: e^{2x}y = 6x + C ⇒ y = (6x+C)e^{−2x}. - Why: Solve for y.\nStep: Use y(0)=1 ⇒ 1 = (0+C) ⇒ C=1 ⇒ y=(6x+1)e^{−2x}. - Why: Apply initial
