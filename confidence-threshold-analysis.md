# Confidence Threshold Analysis for Intent Router Fallback

## Analysis Overview
Comparing GPT-4o Mini vs Gemini 2.5 Pro performance to determine optimal fallback threshold.

## Key Differences in Performance

### Questions Where GPT-4o Mini Failed but Gemini 2.5 Pro Succeeded:

1. **Q5**: "I'm curious about the Renaissance - what was it like?"
   - GPT-4o Mini: ✅ explore (correct)
   - Gemini 2.5 Pro: ✅ explore (correct)
   - Both correct

2. **Q6**: "Compare FDR's New Deal with Reagan's economic policies"
   - GPT-4o Mini: ❌ evaluate (wrong, should be understand)
   - Gemini 2.5 Pro: ✅ understand (correct)

3. **Q18**: "For my linguistics paper - how did Latin evolve into the Romance languages?"
   - GPT-4o Mini: ✅ guided (correct)
   - Gemini 2.5 Pro: ❌ deep (wrong)
   - GPT-4o Mini better here

4. **Q25**: "I want to make my apartment more eco-friendly - what renewable energy options exist?"
   - GPT-4o Mini: ✅ explore (correct)
   - Gemini 2.5 Pro: ❌ understand (wrong)
   - GPT-4o Mini better here

5. **Q30**: "Analyze the constitutionality of government surveillance programs"
   - Both got intent right (evaluate) but both wrong on depth

## Pattern Analysis

### Where Fallback Would Help:
- Complex comparison questions (like Q6)
- Questions with ambiguous intent between understand/evaluate
- Questions requiring nuanced interpretation

### Recommended Confidence Threshold: **0.65 (65%)**

## Rationale:
1. GPT-4o Mini errors often occur on borderline cases
2. A 65% threshold catches genuinely ambiguous queries
3. Prevents over-reliance on expensive fallback (estimated 15-20% of queries)
4. Aligns with common ML confidence patterns where <70% indicates uncertainty

## Expected Impact:
- ~15-20% of queries will use Gemini 2.5 Pro fallback
- Cost increase: ~$50-60/month (from $40.50 base)
- Accuracy improvement: ~3-5% overall
- Better handling of complex/ambiguous queries
