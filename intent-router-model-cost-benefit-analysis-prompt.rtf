\f0\fs24 \cf0 help me continue our accelerated launch dev sprint. review the most recent MOOKTI_COMPLETE_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN doc and session summaries to understand overall goals and what we\'92ve been working on recently. then\
\
help me make a decision regarding model to use with our orchestrator\'92s intent router, a vital component of our primary feature, the ellen chat interface. we\'92ve recently performed extensive testing of various llms as the go-to resource for the intent router. i\'92d like you to please view those results (see student-oriented-v2-comprehensive-report.md), then view llm_pricing_comparison.md to understand the cost of each option we tested, then search and view ALL previous cost assessments we\'92ve made and, if necessary, make a new one based on recent orchestrator v2 implementation, in order to output a table showing me projected cost of using each model we tested with intent router, as well as overall costs of llm calls if we use each model as the default intent router model.}
