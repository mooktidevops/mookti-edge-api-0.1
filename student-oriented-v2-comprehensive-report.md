## Analysis Summary

### Key Findings

1. **Best Overall Performance**: Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved the highest overall score at 74.6%, followed by GPT-5-mini at 70.2%

2. **Intent Classification**: Claude Sonnet 4 showed the best intent classification (91.2%), with GPT-5 and GPT-4o both at 87.7%

3. **Depth Classification**: This was more challenging across all models, with Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5-mini tied at 84.2%

4. **GPT-5 Performance**: GPT-5 (using model ID 'gpt-5') achieved 66.2% overall score with strong intent classification (87.7%) as a reasoning model

5. **Common Challenges**:
   - Distinguishing between "understand" vs "evaluate" intents
   - Correctly identifying "surface" vs "guided" depth levels
   - The "interact" intent was poorly recognized (only 1 correct out of 9 models)

6. **Half-Credit Impact**: The half-credit scoring system revealed nuanced understanding where models identified correct secondary intents even when missing the primary intent

### Recommendations

1. Consider using Gemini 2.5 Pro for production deployment given its superior overall performance
2. Implement fallback strategies for model failures (as seen with GPT-5)
3. Consider ensemble approaches to leverage strengths of different models
4. Focus training/prompting improvements on depth classification which remains challenging
5. The "interact" intent may need clearer definition or examples in the prompt
