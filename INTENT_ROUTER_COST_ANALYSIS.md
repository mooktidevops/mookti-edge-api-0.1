## Implementation Recommendations

### 1. Optimal Configuration (Recommended)
```typescript
// Intent Router Configuration
const INTENT_ROUTER_CONFIG = {
  primary: 'gpt-4o-mini',     // $0.15/$0.60 per M - 67.5% accuracy
  fallback: 'gemini-2.5-pro',  // $1.25/$5.00 per M - 74.6% accuracy
  fallbackThreshold: 0.6       // Use fallback if confidence < 60%
}
```

**Projected Monthly Cost**: $2,850 (66% savings vs baseline)
**Expected Accuracy**: 68-70% weighted average

### 2. Budget Configuration
```typescript
const INTENT_ROUTER_CONFIG = {
  primary: 'gemini-2.5-flash-lite',  // $0.02/$0.08 per M
  fallback: 'gpt-4o-mini',           // $0.15/$0.60 per M
  fallbackThreshold: 0.5
}
```

**Projected Monthly Cost**: $810 (90% savings)
**Expected Accuracy**: 62-64% weighted average

### 3. Performance Configuration
```typescript
const INTENT_ROUTER_CONFIG = {
  primary: 'gemini-2.5-pro',    // $1.25/$5.00 per M
  fallback: 'claude-sonnet-4',   // $3.00/$15.00 per M
  fallbackThreshold: 0.7
}
```

**Projected Monthly Cost**: $8,640 (similar to baseline)
**Expected Accuracy**: 72-75% weighted average

## Critical Insights

### 1. Accuracy vs Cost Non-Linear
- 2x cost doesn't equal 2x accuracy
- Gemini 2.5 Pro offers best accuracy at mid-tier pricing
- Claude Sonnet 4's high cost isn't justified by marginal accuracy gains

### 2. Intent Router as System Bottleneck
- Misclassification cascades through entire interaction
- 10% accuracy improvement = ~25% reduction in correction cycles
- Consider ensemble approach for critical paths

### 3. Model-Specific Strengths
- **Claude Sonnet 4**: Best intent detection (91.2%) but weak on depth
- **GPT-5-mini**: Balanced performance across both dimensions
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Overall champion with consistent high scores

### 4. Cost Amplification Risk
- If intent router uses expensive model, may influence tool selection
- Critical to isolate router costs from execution costs
- Consider caching common intent patterns

## Monitoring & Optimization Plan

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Intent Classification Accuracy** (target: >70%)
2. **Depth Classification Accuracy** (target: >75%)
3. **Fallback Trigger Rate** (target: <20%)
4. **Average Cost per Intent Route** (target: <$0.00005)
5. **Tool Selection Success Rate** (target: >85%)

### Optimization Opportunities
1. **Pattern Caching**: Cache common queryâ†’intent mappings
2. **Confidence Thresholds**: Dynamic adjustment based on user feedback
3. **Model Warm-up**: Pre-load models for common intents
4. **Batch Processing**: Group similar queries when possible

## Conclusion

For the Mookti V2 Orchestrator Intent Router, we recommend:

1. **Primary Choice**: GPT-4o Mini for intent routing
   - Optimal balance of cost ($40.50/month) and accuracy (67.5%)
   - 83.3% intent accuracy ensures good tool selection
   
2. **System-Wide Strategy**: Maintain tiered approach
   - Don't use router model as system default
   - Keep tool-specific model selection
   
3. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - **Monthly Cost**: $2,850 (all systems)
   - **Intent Routing Accuracy**: 67.5%
   - **Cost Savings**: 66% vs current baseline
   - **User Experience**: Significantly improved with proper tool selection

4. **Next Steps**:
   - Implement GPT-4o Mini as intent router
   - Set up monitoring for accuracy metrics
   - Create feedback loop for continuous improvement
   - Consider A/B testing with Gemini 2.5 Pro for high-value users
