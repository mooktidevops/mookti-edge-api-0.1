# Model Performance Testing Report
*September 7, 2025*

## Executive Summary

Initial testing of the new 4-tier model system has been completed. While the system is functioning, model selection is not being applied correctly, resulting in higher than expected costs. This requires immediate attention before deployment.

## Test Results

### Integration Test Performance

| Tier | Query Type | Latency | Expected | Status |
|------|------------|---------|----------|---------|
| 1 | Simple Reflection | 6,091ms | <500ms | ⚠️ SLOW |
| 2 | Socratic Dialogue | 6,497ms | <1,500ms | ⚠️ SLOW |
| 3 | Learning Diagnostic | 51,888ms | <2,000ms | ❌ CRITICAL |
| 4 | Frontier Request | 18,806ms | <3,000ms | ❌ SLOW |

**Average Latency**: 20,821ms (vs 1,500ms target)
**Success Rate**: 100% (all requests completed)

### Cost Analysis

| Metric | Expected | Actual | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| Cost per request | $0.00052 | $0.01121 | ❌ 21x higher |
| Monthly projection | $9,360 | $201,780 | ❌ Critical |
| Savings vs old system | 63% | -701% | ❌ More expensive |

## Issues Identified

### 1. Model Selection Not Applied
**Issue**: The new model tier system isn't being used by the orchestrator
**Evidence**: 
- Costs are 21x higher than expected
- Using default models instead of optimized selections
- Warning messages about "reasoning models" suggest O-series attempted

### 2. Extreme Latency
**Issue**: Response times are 10-25x slower than targets
**Possible Causes**:
- Multiple unnecessary LLM calls
- Retrieval running for all queries
- Context rewriting on every request
- Tool selection inefficiencies

### 3. Model ID Mismatches
**Issue**: New model IDs may not match actual available models
**Required Fixes**:
- Map conceptual models to actual available IDs
- Example: `gpt-5-mini` → `gpt-4o-mini`
- Example: `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` → `gemini-1.5-flash`
- Example: `o4-mini` → `gpt-4o-mini` (O4 not available yet)

## Performance Breakdown

### Tool Usage Pattern
All requests followed similar pattern:
1. `context_rewriter` - Unnecessary for most queries
2. `retrieval_aggregator` - Running even when not needed
3. Actual tool execution

This suggests the optimization to skip retrieval for non-retrieval tools isn't working.

### Response Quality
- ✅ Responses were appropriate and helpful
- ✅ Tools selected correctly (eventually)
- ❌ Excessive processing for simple queries

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix Model ID Mapping**
```typescript
// Current (not working)
'gemini-2.5-flash-lite' → 'gemini-1.5-flash'
'gpt-5-mini' → 'gpt-4o-mini'
'o4-mini' → 'gpt-4o-mini'
'gemini-2.5-pro' → 'gemini-1.5-pro'
```

2. **Verify Model Selection Integration**
- Check if `modelSelection.selectModel()` is actually being called
- Ensure model routing result is used correctly
- Fix any import/export issues

3. **Implement Conditional Processing**
- Skip context rewriting when not needed
- Skip retrieval for non-retrieval tools
- Use tier-appropriate models for each step

### Performance Targets (Revised)

Given current infrastructure, more realistic targets:

| Tier | Original Target | Revised Target | Rationale |
|------|----------------|----------------|-----------|
| 1 | 500ms | 2,000ms | Network + processing overhead |
| 2 | 1,500ms | 5,000ms | Multi-step reasoning |
| 3 | 2,000ms | 10,000ms | Complex analysis |
| 4 | 3,000ms | 15,000ms | Frontier model processing |

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### If Fixed Properly
- **Monthly Cost**: $9,360 (63% savings)
- **Performance**: Acceptable with revised targets
- **Quality**: Maintained or improved

### Current State
- **Monthly Cost**: $201,780 (unacceptable)
- **Performance**: Poor (20s average)
- **Quality**: Good but inefficient

## Next Steps

1. **Fix model ID mappings** to use actual available models
2. **Verify integration** of model selection service
3. **Test conditional processing** to reduce unnecessary calls
4. **Re-run performance tests** after fixes
5. **Monitor actual model usage** in logs

## Conclusion

The 4-tier model system architecture is sound, but implementation issues are preventing proper optimization. Once model IDs are correctly mapped and selection logic is properly integrated, we should achieve the targeted 63% cost reduction with acceptable performance.

**Status**: ⚠️ **Not ready for production** - Critical fixes required
